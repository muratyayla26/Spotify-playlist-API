* to run application, a spotify API client id is required. It is free of charge. Just visit [Spotify dashboard] (https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and follow instructions !
- copy your client id to "const clientId" in the directory of src/util/Spotify.js

* to run application on your local computer, you will need npm:
- check whether you have npm or not; enter "npm -v" on your command line and if you see something like 6.14.8 it means you have npm.
- if you do not, visit [node.js] (https://nodejs.org/tr/download/). Download and install node.js and npm will be installed automatically with it.
- go to the directory of downloaded code in your computer via command line.
- enter "npm install" and when it is finished, then "npm start".
- application should be started automatically on your web browser.
