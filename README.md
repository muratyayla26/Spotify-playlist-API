# Spotify API jammming
I developed this appllication in parallel with codecademy tutorial. It allows users to access their accounts, search for songs, create playlists and add these lists to their spotify accounts.

To run application locally, a spotify API client id is required. It is free of charge. Just visit [Spotify dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and follow instructions!
+ copy your client id to `const clientId=` in the directory of src/util/Spotify.js or create a .env file in the root directory and then create a variable named REACT_APP_API_KEY with client id value from spotify dashboard.

To run application on your local computer, you will need npm:
+ check whether you have npm or not; enter `npm -v` on your command line and if you see something like 6.14.8 it means you have npm.
+ if you do not, visit [node.js](https://nodejs.org/tr/download/). Download and install node.js and npm will be installed automatically with it.
+ go to the directory of downloaded code in your computer via command line.
+ enter `npm install` and when it is finished, then `npm start`.
+ application should be started automatically on your web browser.
